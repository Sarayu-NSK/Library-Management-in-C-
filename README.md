In this digital age, a web-based library management system 
would be ideal for students who can access the library’s 
database on their devices.

The library management system software is user-friendly and 
is within the reach of students’ needs
It displays the name of the books, author name, publication 
name, and book number including whether the book is available 
in the library.
 
It is helpful for both the librarian and the users to manage and 
know the details of the books available.
The library management focuses on the possibility of 
searching for books by title, author or subject by the member. 
They will be able to locate a book physically by the book number. 
The system also provides the details of the books held by the 
members.

The library management system software is cloud-based. Its 
basic function is to store all the data about the materials found 
in a library in a secured cloud data storage. Aside from that, it 
helps the management maintain a smooth flow of materials in 
the library
